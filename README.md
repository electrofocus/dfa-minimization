# DFA minimization algorithm

The [program code](https://github.com/electrofocus/dfa-minimization/blob/master/dfa_minimization.ipynb) is presented in Jupiter Notebook. The algorithm accepts the DFA in a [text file](https://github.com/electrofocus/dfa-minimization/blob/master/input.txt), displays the image of the read DFA, performs minimization and displays the image of the minimized DFA.
The option of generating random DFA is also available.
To display the graph, the graffiz library is used.

The program is implemented as part of the [Pavel Panteleev's](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/panteleev/) 'Compiler construction' course.
